# Defra Ruby Email

> Work in progress. This project is not yet complete!

A Rails Engine used by the [Ruby services team](https://github.com/DEFRA/ruby-services-team) in their digital services.

We use it to allow us to access the content of the last email sent by an app. This information is used by our [acceptance tests](https://github.com/DEFRA/waste-carriers-acceptance-tests) to confirm emails are being sent with the expected content.

When mounted in an app, it will add a new route which when called, will return details of the last email as JSON.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you already have:

- Ruby 2.4.2
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) â€“ for installing Ruby gems

## Installation

You don't need to do this if you're just mounting the engine without making any changes.

However, if you want to edit the engine, you'll have to install it locally.

Clone the repo and drop into the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DEFRA/defra-ruby-email.git && cd defra-ruby-email
```

Then install the dependencies with `bundle install`.

## Testing the engine

The engine is mounted in a dummy Rails 4 app (in /spec/dummy) so we can properly test its behaviour.

The test suite is written in RSpec.

To run all the tests, use `bundle exec rspec`.
